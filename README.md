## Goal
The exercise is built with the theory part in mind and with the intention to check the understanding of the learning material.

## Description of the exercise

You are expected to build the application (described below) and make it available online (the source code and hosted version of the application must be available).

You are expected to use the following things when doing the exercise:
- The application should be built with AOT compilation.  
- Angular Material components;
- Angular Forms; 
- Use NgRx;
- Please use the Reactive Programming (RxJS); 
Recommendations (you can also use alternative tools if you like.. GitLab etc.):
- GitHub repository and GitHub Pages for deployment; 
- GitHub Actions for a build;

## Steps to complete
1. Create a list of blog posts using the following API: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
2. Create the page where the comments are available for the specific post (content must be available using direct URL)  
3. Create a separate page for a Guest Book with the list of entries and also create a form for adding those entries.

The entry should contain the following fields: Author (fields can be defined as you like â†’ name, e-mail etc...) and Message (length has the minimal limit of 20 symbols). Both (the Author and Message) are mandatory fields.

4. Create a pop-up (should be available from the Guest Book) with the Author info (*use Gravatar for avatars).

5. Create unit tests to check the business logic of the application (*create end-to-end tests).  

6.* Create filtering and sorting options for the list of blog posts.  

7.* Create an option to add Ratings for each post.

\* completion of these parts of the exercise is optional.
